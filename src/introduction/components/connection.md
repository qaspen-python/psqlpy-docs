title: Connection
---

`Connection` object represents single connection to the `PostgreSQL`. You must work with database within it.  
`Connection` get be made with `PSQLPool().connection()` method.

```python
from psqlpy import PSQLPool


db_pool: Final = PSQLPool(
    dsn="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres",
)


async def main() -> None:
    ...
    connection = await db_pool.connection()
```

## Connection methods

### Execute

#### Parameters:

- `querystring`: Statement string.
- `parameters`: List of parameters for the statement string.
- `prepared`: Prepare statement before execution or not.

You can execute any query directly from `Connection` object.  
This method supports parameters, each parameter must be marked as `$<number>` in querystring (number starts with 1).

```python
async def main() -> None:
    ...
    connection = await db_pool.connection()
    results: QueryResult = await connection.execute(
        "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1 and username = $2",
        [100, "Alex"],
    )

    dict_results: list[dict[str, Any]] = results.result()
```

### Execute Many

#### Parameters:

- `querystring`: Statement string.
- `parameters`: List of list of parameters for the statement string.
- `prepared`: Prepare statement before execution or not.

This method supports parameters, each parameter must be marked as `$<number>` in querystring (number starts with 1).
Atomicity is provided, so you don't need to worry about unsuccessful result, because there is a transaction used internally.
This method returns nothing.

```python
async def main() -> None:
    ...
    connection = await db_pool.connection()
    await connection.execute_many(
        "INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ($1, $2)",
        [["boba", 10], ["boba", 20]],
    )
```

### Fetch Row

#### Parameters:

- `querystring`: Statement string.
- `parameters`: List of list of parameters for the statement string.
- `prepared`: Prepare statements before execution or not.

Sometimes you need to fetch only first row from the result.
::: warning
Querystring must return exactly one result or an exception will be raised.
:::

```python
async def main() -> None:
    ...
    connection = await db_pool.connection()
    query_result: SingleQueryResult = await transaction.fetch_row(
        "SELECT username FROM users WHERE id = $1",
        [100],
    )
    dict_result: Dict[Any, Any] = query_result.result()
```

### Fetch Val

#### Parameters

- `querystring`: Statement string.
- `parameters`: List of list of parameters for the statement string.
- `prepared`: Prepare statements before execution or not.

If you need to retrieve some value not `QueryResult`.
::: warning
Querystring must return exactly one result or an exception will be raised.
:::

```python
async def main() -> None:
    ...
    connection = await db_pool.connection()
    # this will be an int value
    query_result_value = await connection.fetch_row(
        "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE id > $1",
        [100],
    )
```

### Transaction

`Connection` is the only object that can be used to build `Transaction` object.

#### Parameters:

- `isolation_level`: level of isolation. Default how it is in PostgreSQL.
- `read_variant`: configure read variant of the transaction. Default how it is in PostgreSQL.
- `deferrable`: configure deferrable of the transaction. Default how it is in PostgreSQL.

```python
from psqlpy import IsolationLevel, ReadVariant

async def main() -> None:
    ...
    connection = await db_pool.connection()
    transaction = connection.transaction(
        isolation_level=IsolationLevel.Serializable,
        read_variant=ReadVariant.ReadWrite,
        deferrable=True,
    )
```
